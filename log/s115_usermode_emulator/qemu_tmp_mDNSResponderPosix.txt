For reproducing the EMBA user-mode emulation mechanism, the following commands could be used as starting point:

 - Start EMBA docker container with the firmware directory as log directory:
      # [0;33mEMBA="." FIRMWARE="/home/kali/Downloads/DCS-935L_A1_FW_1.09.02_20160713_r3952.bin" LOG="/absolute/path/to/EMBA/log/directory" docker-compose run emba[0m

 - Change your working directory to the root directory of your firmware:
      # [0;33mcd /logs/s115_usermode_emulator/firmware/unblob_extracted/firmware_extract/1446946-7513122.squashfs_v4_le_extract[0m

 - Copy the static compiled user-mode emulator to your current working directory
      # [0;33mcp $(which qemu-mips-static) .[0m

 - Start the emulation with the following command: 
      # [0;33mjchroot  . -- ./qemu-mips-static ./usr/sbin/mDNSResponderPosix <parameters like -v or --help>[0m

[0;33mWARNING: EMBA is doing some more magic in the background. Probably it is not that easy, but give it a try.[0m
