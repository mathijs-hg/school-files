[1m=================================================================[0m
This module tries to identify the Linux kernel binary and extracts the kernel with the vmlinux-to-elf project
Additionally, it tries to extract the kernel configuration.
Based on this extraction it is possible to further analyze the kernel configuration and the kernel
