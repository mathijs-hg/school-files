        Issue description:
    The software uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, or uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive, which can produce an unexpected value. When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using negative return values can have unexpected results. Although less frequent an issue, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be  the precursor to buffer underwrite conditions. Buffer underwrites  occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values,  and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.

        Issue description:
    The software uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, or uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive, which can produce an unexpected value. When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using negative return values can have unexpected results. Although less frequent an issue, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be  the precursor to buffer underwrite conditions. Buffer underwrites  occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values,  and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.
