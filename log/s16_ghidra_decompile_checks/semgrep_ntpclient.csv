The auditor can backtrace from these candidate points to find pathways allowing access from untrusted input.
/tmp/haruspex_ntpclient/FUN_004010e8_004010e8.c,external.semgrep-rules-0xdea.c.raptor-signed-unsigned-conversion,134,The software uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, or uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive, which can produce an unexpected value. When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using negative return values can have unexpected results. Although less frequent an issue, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be  the precursor to buffer underwrite conditions. Buffer underwrites  occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values,  and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.
/tmp/haruspex_ntpclient/contemplate_data_00402ed0.c,external.semgrep-rules-0xdea.c.raptor-format-string-bugs,103,The software uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source. This can lead  to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems.
