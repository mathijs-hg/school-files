The kernel verification module extracts the kernel symbols and matches these symbols against the CVE data. The CVE data was first collected from the version identifier only.
Additionally, this module tries to compile the kernel with a configuration file that was extracted from module s24. This technique was first documented here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.05217.pdf
